## Rollup React Boilerplate

a working and up to date boilerplate for React apps built with rollup

it works for https://github.com/sw-yx/rollup-plugin-react-sfc but it is SUPER hacky (see index.html)

The rollup plugin uses [`react-sfc`](https://github.com/react-sfc/react-sfc-swyx) under the hood. Go there for fuller details on how to write it.
